# The Event
PyLadies LA had a great event, **[Lightning Talks || Python Applications](https://www.meetup.com/Pyladies-LA/events/254903299/)**, on November 7, 2018. 


## The Talks

#### 1. pyTesting for Everyone - Irina Kukuyeva 
(**[GitHub](https://github.com/ikukuyeva/pytest-talk-Pyladies-LA-2018)**, 
**[Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1l7H9v-dXrjYsfTJjkduvBP6TfFJiUJ8j8SRlRyA-Enk/)**)

We've all heard that we should be testing our code and getting good test coverage. This talk will give an overview of 4 types of tests: unit, integration, regression and parametrized test, via examples in pytest. You'll write more robust code in no-time, no prior testing experience necessary.

#### 2. Build a micro service using Python's nameko - Nathan Danielsen

Walk through an exploration of building python and other language micro-services with nameko. Nameko is a python framework for building micro-services with lots of time saving tools and 3rd party plugins.

#### 3. Use Python's psycopg2 package to build a data ETL (extract transform load) pipeline with Apache Airflow + Postgres - Naomi Lai 
(**[Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1eO1lElxkErwOc6MaitzgccpJcUOmfz1mf5UgcsevmO8/)**)

Working with data pipelines can be a pain, whether you're running the tasks one after another or bundling them together with cron jobs. Airflow alleviates the pain by turning your tasks into nodes that runs as part of a DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) with each task chained to its previous task's completion. With Airflow you can concurrently manage multiple pipelines, track your task run time, chain multiple DAGs together into a larger pipeline, all the while maintaining separation of concern and doing all this with a language you're already familiar with: Python!

### Hope to see you next time!
